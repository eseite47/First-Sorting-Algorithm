# First-Sorting-Algorithm
My first sorting algorithm 

Challenge found on cadewars.com:
Given an array of numbers, sort them in such a manner that all the odd numbers in the array are sorted in ascending order and the even numbers are sorted in descending order after the last odd number. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] produces the output [1,3,5,7,9,8,6,4,2]. If the array contains decimals, round them down while checking for odd/even. The output must have the original numbers!

Swap and SwapTest
These program reflect my first approach, which was to use a sorting method inspired by the bubble sort. I have not been able to get the swap to work properly yet.

SwapTwo and SwapTestTwo
In a different approach, I separated odd and even numbers into two separate arrays, and the sorted each array. This worked!
